# Pizzeria

This program will simulate a pizzeria. Allowing the user to pick an available pizzeria when the program first start.

Throughout this project, there will be more features added into this program to improve the user experience. The roadmap for this project is
- Create an object representing the pizzeria. Each object will contain different address and ingredients in stock.
- Create an object representing a pizza, with the toppings being chosen by the user. The toppings will be limited by what's in stock.
- Allow the user to visit a pizzeria of their choice and ordering their own pizza.
- Creating a database using MySQL to store pizzeria's data, offloading current data in the program to the database.
- Refactor the program to create RESTFUL APIs, so that users can use a website to simulate ordering a pizza.
